\section{Introduction}

As for this document I will just type the problems that I solved and the locations or origin of them in order to create a sense of progress. For some I will provide commentary or the solution as I learn Latex and I might section them off based on the type of questions or source

\section {Start}
2013 AIME II 2 solved
\newline
Commentary: This problem just involved fairly trivial log manipulations and then casework at the end
\newline
2013 AIME II 5 solved
\newline
Not much work as simple application of law of cosines and sine area formula, an alternative was drawing a perpendicular as I notice is a trend in many early AIME mid-late AMC geo problems
\newline
BMT individual 2012 spring 2012 1 and 2 solved

Find the sum of the prime factors of 898989.
Well the basic way that I approached the problem was that I approached it as $89(10^4+10^2+1)$ and then I proceeded to factor that using completing the square, fairly trivial imo.
\begin {itemize}
\item Let S be the set of primes p satisfying p < 150 and
2 + 3 + 4 + · · · + p is congruent to 0 (mod 13).
Find the sum of all elements in S. This problem involed doing standard sum then factoring and doing casework and this is pretty basic for an AIME level problem next question por favor
\item

\end{itemize}
